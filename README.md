# Home Appliance Detection from Power Consumption

## Introduction
In modern smart homes, efficiently managing energy consumption is crucial. This project focuses on the classification of household appliances based on the overall power consumption curve of a house. By analyzing the aggregated load data, we aim to determine which specific devices are in use at any given time. This approach leverages advanced machine learning techniques to provide real-time insights and improve energy management, offering a smart solution for both energy savings and enhanced convenience in home automation.
